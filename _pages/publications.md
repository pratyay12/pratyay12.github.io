**A Comparative Study On Speech Emotion Recognition**

Today's world has been "Chatting" with the machines for a long time. With the first known research paper by Daellert et. al on this topic, we can say that discussions on Speech Emotion Recognition technology have been there for such a long time and have been evolving and increasing its applications in our life. Although worthy of these many applications, speech emotion recognition is a challenging task as emotion is a subjective thing. Not all humans are the same, each human deals differently with emotions. There are no common criteria or steps to categorize emotions. Forget computers, even we humans at times fail to read the emotions behind the other person. This paper provides the list of some speech emotion recognition methods and a glimpse of method used.
